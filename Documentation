The following project is a simple banking app that allows the user to check their account
balance, make deposits, and withdraw money from their accounts. It has 3 tests one to check
if the account exists, one to check if it allows deposits, and another to check if it allows
withdrawls.

The code follows clean code practices and there are many examples to show this. The first being 
meaningful naming. variables like customerName and accountBal are clear and meaningful and allow 
anyone who is reading the code to understand exactly what is being referenced. Another example is
the method names. Methods like deposit(), withdraw(), and getBalance() are clear, concise, and very
self-explanatory. Finally the Account class demonstarates the Single Responsibility Principle. It has
clear single responsibility: managing the account's balance and handling withdraw and deposit operations.
This shows it is focused on account related functionality only.

This project used dependincies from maven central repository more specifically junit-jupiter.

I did however run iton some issues with the actions on github. I am struggling with getting them to pass 
I guess i just need some more time to learn them.
